jwt workflow:

- use put some data and use jwt.sign to create the token by passing the userID {this is integral part of jwt for every token created, unique one for every one}, assign the _id to this userID 
- while verifying pass token and secretKey, the decoded token will contain the same userID as given earlier.

    var token=jwt.sign({userID:getUser.id},secretKey)
eg  const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token,secretKey); 
set req.id=decodeToken.userID
now every subsequent requests can be authorized.

- for firstLogin --> signin return the token, take that token and set in headers of every subsequent requests

NEW_LEARNING_2: configure tailwind.config.js file when rendering everything.
